Implement 3-party chat using UDP based on IPv6. For the program specify the command 
line arguments as follows 
 -n <name of chatter> 
 -a <ipv6 address to be used by this program> 
 -p <port number on which this program will receive chat msgs from others> 
 -d <ipv6 address of 2nd party>,<ipv6 address of 3rd party> 
 -r <port number of 2nd party>,<port number of 3rd party> 
The program will receive inputs on command line and send the same to other chat partners. 
When the program receives the input from other chat partners, it should display the same on 
console along with its id.
